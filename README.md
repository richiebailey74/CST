# CST

Code for Class Separation Transformation experiments are split into directories for each individual contributor.

The Aisharjya directory contains a zip file that can be downloaded containing bash scripts that conduct the paper's experiments and associated data preprocessing.

The Aaditya directory contains follow up experiments with the same data generated from the Aisharjya directory, except done within an ipynb for enhanced readability.

The Richie directory contains experiments conducted with different datasets, the non-hyperparameter tuning experiments, and the associated data preprocessing of the additional data - all in ipynb files. It also has an importable CST.py file containing the CST class.
